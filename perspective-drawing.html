<h1 class="title">Obnoxious notes to perspective drawing</h1>
<p class="author">Heiegg</p>
<p class="date">2021-04-06</p>
</header>
<p>These are our notes to studying perspective without the crutch of
cubes. Oh, well, as we added some notes on how to apply this to drawing,
there are cubes now. We think this definitely helped with our drawing
skills. Please let us know any inaccuracies.</p>
<h1 id="sec:persp-proj-map">The Perspective Projection Map</h1>
<p>We consider the <span class="math inline">3</span>-dimensional
Euclidean space <span class="math inline">\mathbb {R}^3</span>. Let
<span class="math inline">V</span> be the viewing plane and <span
class="math inline">O</span> be the eye point. Then the perspective
drawing is, in essence, the projection to <span
class="math inline">V</span> with respect to <span
class="math inline">O</span>. More precisely, the image of a point <span
class="math inline">P</span> in space is the point of intersection of
the line <span class="math inline">OP</span> and the plane <span
class="math inline">V</span>. Let <span class="math inline">f</span>
denote this map.</p>
<p>[TODO: figure of map]</p>
<p>Without loss of generality, we set <span class="math inline">O</span>
to be the origin and <span class="math inline">V</span> to be the plane
<span class="math inline">z=1</span>. Then the map <span
class="math inline">f</span> is given by: <span
class="math display">\begin{aligned}
  f: \mathbb {R}^3\backslash \{z=0\} &amp;\rightarrow V \\
  (x,y,z) &amp;\mapsto (x/z,y/z,1).
\end{aligned}</span> We may identify the affine space <span
class="math inline">V</span> with <span class="math inline">\mathbb
{R}^2</span> by taking the vector part, more precisely, by dropping the
<span class="math inline">z</span>-coordinate. In application, we
restrict <span class="math inline">f</span> to the domain <span
class="math inline">z&gt;0</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">W</span> be a plane. As long as <span
class="math inline">W</span> does not pass <span
class="math inline">O</span>, then <span class="math inline">f|_W</span>
is a bijection.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">C</span> be intersection of the locus
of a degree <span class="math inline">n</span> polynomial <span
class="math inline">p</span> with the plane <span
class="math inline">W</span>, i.e., the points on <span
class="math inline">C</span> satisfies <span
class="math inline">p</span> in addition to a degree <span
class="math inline">1</span> polynomial. In this case, it is easy to see
that points on the image of <span class="math inline">C</span> also
satisfies a degree <span class="math inline">n</span> polynomial.</p>
<p>In particular, <span class="math inline">f</span> maps lines to lines
and conics to conics. Signature is not preserved however. Thus it is
possible for the types of conics to change. In application, the image of
an ellipse must be an ellipse; otherwise, the source ellipse intersects
the <span class="math inline">xy</span>-plane. This can be seen by going
back to the original meaning of conics: curves cut from cones by
planes.</p>
<h1 id="sec:vanishing-point">The Vanishing Point</h1>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\mathbf {v}</span> be a vector. Let
<span class="math inline">\ell</span> be a line passing through a point
<span class="math inline">P</span> and parallel to <span
class="math inline">\mathbf {v}</span>. Then points on <span
class="math inline">\ell</span> can be parametrised as <span
class="math display">P + t\mathbf {v},\qquad t\in\mathbb {R}.</span> Let
the coordinates of <span class="math inline">P</span> be given by <span
class="math inline">(x_P,y_P,z_P)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\mathbf {v}</span> given by <span
class="math inline">(v_1,v_2,v_3)</span>. Then if <span
class="math inline">v_3\neq 0</span>, i.e., <span
class="math inline">\mathbf {v}</span> is not parallel to <span
class="math inline">V</span>, then <span
class="math display">\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} f (P + t\mathbf {v})
  = \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}
(\frac{x_P+tv_1}{z_P+tv_3},\frac{y_P+tv_2}{z_P+tv_3},1)
  = (\frac{v_1}{v_3},\frac{v_2}{v_3},1).</span> This point is called the
vanishing point of <span class="math inline">\ell</span>. If <span
class="math inline">v_3=0</span>, we should consider infinity to be the
vanishing point. The meaning of infinity and which infinity point can be
made precise by using projective geometry. Let <span
class="math inline">\mathcal {C}_\mathbf {v}</span> be the collection of
lines parallel to <span class="math inline">\mathbf {v}</span>. In fact,
the vanishing point depends only on <span class="math inline">\mathbf
{v}</span>, not on the choice of <span class="math inline">\ell</span>
in <span class="math inline">\mathcal {C}_\mathbf {v}</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\mathcal {C}_\mathbf {v}</span> be the collection of
lines parallel to <span class="math inline">\mathbf {v}</span>. Thus
every line in <span class="math inline">\mathcal {C}_\mathbf {v}</span>
has the same vanishing point. Thus their images appear to radiate from
one point. Note that if we restrict to the <span
class="math inline">z&gt;0</span> part, the image is a ray.</p>
<p>[TODO: figure of VP for parallel lines.]</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\ell_O</span> be the line which is
parallel to <span class="math inline">v</span> and which contains <span
class="math inline">O</span>. Geometrically the vanishing point for
<span class="math inline">\mathcal {C}_\mathbf {v}</span> is just the
point of intersection of <span class="math inline">\ell_O</span> and
<span class="math inline">V</span>.</p>
<p>Thus we can answer the question of how many vanishing points there
are in a drawing. The answer is the number of lines with different
direction vectors. In scenes like cityscape, there are generally three
sets of parallel lines with different direction vectors. Each produces a
vanishing point as long as the set of lines are not parallel to <span
class="math inline">V</span>. We get the so-called 3-point, 2-point and
1-point perspectives.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">W</span> be a plane. The set of
vanishing points of lines contained in <span
class="math inline">W</span> form a line. Geometrically it is given by
intersecting the plane passing through <span
class="math inline">O</span> and parallel to <span
class="math inline">W</span> with <span class="math inline">V</span>.
Let us call it the vanishing line of <span class="math inline">W</span>.
In application, when <span class="math inline">W</span> is taken to be
the ground plane, the vanishing line of <span
class="math inline">W</span> is usually called the horizon or eye
level.</p>
<p>[TODO: figure of VL for parallel planes.]</p>
<p>In practice, image of lines are easy to determine once we put down
the vanishing points. If we know a point to be the intersections of two
lines, we may find its image by finding the intersection of the images
of the two lines. As line segments of the same length do not map to line
segments of the same length under the perspective projection, this
provides an easy way to determine location of image of a point. We can
find the image of the centre of a rectangle by intersecting the
diagonals of the image of the rectangle, for example. Once we know the
image of the centre, we can find image of the disecting points and hence
we know how to find the image of the rectangle that extends the original
rectangle by one time of its width.</p>
<h1 id="sec:transfer-distance">Measuring Distance</h1>
<p>The aim of this section is to study images of line segments of equal
length. In application, essentially we operate on <span
class="math inline">V</span> only. One problem arises often. We have the
image of a line segment as reference. How do we find the image of the
same length along another line?</p>
<p>What we have available are the vanishing points and the reference
line segment on <span class="math inline">V</span>. Once we supply the
information of the relative position of <span
class="math inline">O</span> to the lines, then we can transfer the
distance from one line to another.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\ell</span> be a line. Let <span
class="math inline">P</span> and <span class="math inline">Q</span> be
two points on <span class="math inline">\ell</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\ell&#39;</span> be another line that passes through
<span class="math inline">P</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">R</span> be a point on <span
class="math inline">\ell&#39;</span> such that <span
class="math inline">|PQ|=|PR|</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">A</span> be the vanishing point of <span
class="math inline">\ell</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span>
that of <span class="math inline">\ell&#39;</span>. We would like to
find <span class="math inline">f (R)</span> in terms of <span
class="math inline">f (P)</span>, <span class="math inline">f
(Q)</span>, <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span
class="math inline">B</span>.</p>
<p>One observation is that if we know the vanishing point <span
class="math inline">C</span> of <span class="math inline">QR</span> then
<span class="math inline">f (R)</span> can be found as the intersection
of the line connecting <span class="math inline">CQ</span> and the line
connecting <span class="math inline">BP</span>. However the location of
<span class="math inline">C</span> cannot be determined by <span
class="math inline">f (P)</span>, <span class="math inline">f
(Q)</span>, <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span
class="math inline">B</span> alone. We need an additional piece of data,
the location of <span class="math inline">O</span> relative to <span
class="math inline">\ell</span> and <span
class="math inline">\ell&#39;</span>. We focus on the plane <span
class="math inline">W</span> through <span class="math inline">O</span>
and parallel to both <span class="math inline">\ell</span> and <span
class="math inline">\ell&#39;</span>. We translate <span
class="math inline">\ell</span> and <span
class="math inline">\ell&#39;</span> to <span
class="math inline">W</span> along a vector that is parallel to <span
class="math inline">V</span> and orthogonal to <span
class="math inline">AB</span>. We use superscript <span
class="math inline">t</span> to denote the translated object. On <span
class="math inline">(\ell&#39;)^t</span> find the point <span
class="math inline">S</span> such that <span
class="math inline">|P^tS|=|P^tQ^t|</span>. Note that <span
class="math inline">QR</span> is parallel to <span
class="math inline">Q^tS</span>. Then <span class="math inline">C</span>
is the intersection of <span class="math inline">AB</span> and <span
class="math inline">Q^tS</span>.</p>
<p>[TODO: figure view of <span class="math inline">V</span>.]</p>
<p>[TODO: figure view of <span class="math inline">W</span> to get <span
class="math inline">C</span>]</p>
<p>In practice, <span class="math inline">\ell</span> and <span
class="math inline">\ell&#39;</span> are orthogonal, forming two edges
of a cube.</p>
<h1 id="sec:application-drawing">Application to Drawing</h1>
<h2 id="sec:centre-rect-extens">Centre of rectangle and extension of
length</h2>
<p>This is already mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="sec:shadow">Shadow</h2>
<p>This is an application of the intersection method. One common need is
to find the cast shadow of a stick that stands vertically on the ground
under sunlight. Sunlight can be considered as parallel light with given
direction <span class="math inline">\mathbf {v}</span>. The location of
shadow of the foot <span class="math inline">F</span> of the stick is
obvious. Let <span class="math inline">P</span> be the top of the stick.
The location of shadow <span class="math inline">Q</span> of top of
stick lies on the line parallel to <span class="math inline">\mathbf
{v}</span> through <span class="math inline">P</span>. It also lies on
the ground plane <span class="math inline">G</span>. Thus it lies on the
line <span class="math inline">L</span> that is the intersection of the
plane parallel to the vertical direction and <span
class="math inline">\mathbf {v}</span> through <span
class="math inline">P</span> and the plane <span
class="math inline">G</span>. Also consider the line <span
class="math inline">M</span> through the shadow point <span
class="math inline">Q</span> on the ground <span
class="math inline">G</span> perpendicular to <span
class="math inline">V</span>. If we consider the component <span
class="math inline">\mathbf {w}</span> of light that is parallel to
<span class="math inline">V</span>, then the line through <span
class="math inline">P</span> along <span class="math inline">\mathbf
{w}</span> intersects <span class="math inline">M</span> and call the
intersection <span class="math inline">R</span>. Thus we get two lines
whose intersection gives the shadow point <span
class="math inline">Q</span>.</p>
<p>To find the image of <span class="math inline">Q</span> on <span
class="math inline">V</span>, we consider the two families of parallel
lines determined by <span class="math inline">L</span> and <span
class="math inline">M</span> respectively. The family of parallel lines
associated to <span class="math inline">L</span> produces a vanishing
point, which we call the ground vanishing point of light (GVPL). Thus
<span class="math inline">f (Q)</span> lies on the line connecting <span
class="math inline">f (F)</span> and GVPL. The point <span
class="math inline">f (R)</span> is easy to find, if we know <span
class="math inline">f (F)</span> and the horizon line and the <span
class="math inline">V</span>-component <span class="math inline">\mathbf
{w}</span> of <span class="math inline">\mathbf {v}</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">C</span> be the vanishing point for the receding
lines that are parallel to the normal of <span
class="math inline">V</span>. Then <span class="math inline">f
(Q)</span> also lies on the line connecting <span
class="math inline">C</span> and <span class="math inline">f (R)</span>.
Then using the intersection of the two lines we find <span
class="math inline">f (Q)</span>.</p>
<p>Summary: Shadow of top=(GLVP–foot) <span
class="math inline">\cap</span> (centre–horizontal shadow drop).</p>
<p>This can be generalised to finding cast shadow of any point to any
plane which may not be orthogonal to the viewing plane. In this case
direction of light can be encoded in vanishing point of shadow on the
plane and vanishing point of component of light on the plane which is
orthogonal to the given plane and which is parallel to the line of
intersection of the given plane and the viewing plane. We should give
this plane a name to avoid long-winded sentences.</p>
<h1 id="sec:projective-geometry">Projective Geometry</h1>
<p>It is cumbersome to always have to differentiate between the cases
when family of parallel lines has image lines that radiate from one
point or lines that remain parallel. It is best to add points at
‘infinity’. How many points of infinities are there? In <span
class="math inline">\mathbb {R}^2</span> the families of parallel lines
are indexed by direction vectors. Thus we should glue on <span
class="math inline">\mathbb {P}^1:= (\mathbb {R}^2 - \{0\})/\mathbb
{R}^\times</span> of them. This gives us the projective space <span
class="math inline">\mathbb {P}^2</span>, in which <span
class="math inline">\mathbb {R}^2</span> is embedded as follows: <span
class="math display">\begin{aligned}
  \mathbb {R}^2 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbb {P}^2 \\
  (x,y) &amp;\mapsto (x:y:1)
\end{aligned}</span> while points at infinity embed as follows: <span
class="math display">\begin{aligned}
  \mathbb {P}^1 &amp;\rightarrow \mathbb {P}^2\\
  (a:b) &amp;\mapsto (a:b:0).
\end{aligned}</span> Once we call the point <span
class="math inline">(a:b:0)</span> the vanishing point of family of
parallel line along the vector <span class="math inline">(a,b,0)</span>,
then we can write the theory in a more uniform way.</p>
<h1 id="sec:intersection-method">Intersection Method</h1>
<p>One can use two VLs to determine VP of the intersection line and one
can also use VPs of two lines to determine VL of the plane parallel to
both lines.</p>
