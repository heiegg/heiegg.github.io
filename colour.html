<h1 id="sec:ausp-beginn-notes">Auspicious beginning of notes on colour
theory</h1>
<p>What is colour?</p>
<p>It is a sensation arising from light hitting you.</p>
<p>What is light?</p>
<p>Lol, as if we knew. Here’s an attempt. It is electromagnetic wave and
also a bunch of photon particles.</p>
<h1 id="sec:spec-best-our">Speculations based on shaky foundation to the
best of our knowledge</h1>
<p>As electromagnetic wave, light has properties such as frequencies
<span class="math inline">f</span> and wavelengths <span
class="math inline">\lambda</span>. By property of wave, <span
class="math inline">f\lambda = c</span> where <span
class="math inline">c</span> is the speed of light in the medium.
Different wavelengths cause the cones in human eyes to produce varying
responses. (The cones are in a fixed medium. It is not clear to us if
the wavelengths of light in various charts in the references are tied to
this particular medium or not.) Each parcel of light carries energy. The
energy of a photon with frequency <span class="math inline">f</span> is
equal to <span class="math inline">hf</span> where <span
class="math inline">h</span> is the Planck constant.</p>
<p>Now consider the scenario of looking at an object. Light has bounced
around or got absorbed and re-emitted etc and finally reaches your eye.
Specular reflection generally does not change the frequency distribution
of light, while diffuse reflection causes changes <span class="citation"
data-cites="briggs-dim-colour">(Briggs, n.d., sec. 2.1)</span>. We
suppose one can always design devious material to make this false.</p>
<p>Assume you are a generic human. Then you are tri-chromatic with cones
of types L, M and S. For given light, let <span class="math inline">n
(f)</span> be the number of photons as a function of given frequency
<span class="math inline">f</span>. Since energy carried by the photons
of given frequency is proportional to their number, <span
class="math inline">n</span> is similar to spectral power distribution
of the light and we will call it spectral distribution of the given
light. For each frequency, each type of cones produce a response of a
certain strength. The more photons, the stronger the response. Let the
response function be <span class="math inline">r_i (f,n)</span> where
<span class="math inline">f</span> is the frequency and <span
class="math inline">n</span> the number of photons with frequency <span
class="math inline">f</span> hitting one cone of type <span
class="math inline">i</span> per unit time. Here <span
class="math inline">i</span> is L or M or S. It seems that <span
class="math inline">r_i</span> is largely linear with respect to <span
class="math inline">n</span> at least when <span
class="math inline">n</span> is not too small or too big. There is
always some threshold you need to go beyond to get any response and when
you are hit by too much energy, you die in general. Then we get the
total response <span class="math inline">R_i</span> to the given light
for each type of cone by integrating over all frequencies. This is
actually a finite sum as we have only finitely many photons hitting you
per unit time. Note that <span class="math inline">n</span> is a
function of <span class="math inline">f</span> when the light is given.
With <span class="math inline">R_i</span>’s produced, they are
transformed by opponent cells into three other outputs, one being
achromatic which is just <span class="math inline">R_\mathrm
{L}+R_\mathrm {M}+R_\mathrm {S}</span>, the other two being chromatic
opponencies, which are given by <span class="math inline">R_\mathrm
{L}-R_\mathrm {M}</span> and <span class="math inline">R_\mathrm {S}-
(R_\mathrm {L}+ R_\mathrm {M})</span>. This is a bijective function. The
exact functions may be off, but the next sentence holds regardless. The
former one measures brightness; the latter two quantities give a
quantitative measure of how biased the spectral distribution is. It
should be pointed out that a lot of information is lost in this process.
Many different frequency distributions give rise to the same responses
and they are called metamers and are indistinguishable to your visual
system. Let us call the set of frequency distributions that are
metameric to each other a metameric packet.</p>
<p>A naive generalisation to <span
class="math inline">k</span>-chromatic creatures is as follows. First
they get <span class="math inline">R_i</span> for <span
class="math inline">i=1,\ldots,k</span> and then these are transformed
into brightness and <span class="math inline">k-1</span> opponencies,
which quantify hue and colourfulness. Thus the total sensation/colour
space is a domain in a Euclidean space of dimension <span
class="math inline">k</span>. This domain should be compact and
convex.</p>
<p>Due to the brain’s precognitive process (lightness constancy) of
compensating for differences in illumination, it is natural to normalise
brightness and colourfulness to account for illumination condition. One
way to quantify the illumination condition is to use the brightness of a
reference object, which should reflect a balanced distribution of
frequencies. Thus we define lightness (resp. chroma) as brightness
(resp. colourfulness) to brightness of the reference object under the
same illumination condition. As lightness and chroma are mostly
independent of illumination condition (within a reasonable range), they
are perceived as intrinsic to the object. There are other constancies at
play, such as colour constancy which makes us to perceive different
colours at points when our cones produce the same responses. This gives
rise to the two different notions of colour, perceived colour and
psychophysical colour.</p>
<p>We now try to describe more precisely the normalised sensation/colour
space. When we hold lightness constant, the section of the normalised
sensation/colour space is of dimension <span
class="math inline">k-1</span>. We may perceive this to be a compact
convex <span class="math inline">(k-1)</span>-dimensional domain that is
diffeomorphic to a <span class="math inline">(k-1)</span>-ball. On the
boundary of the domain, we sense the most bias in spectral distribution
and recognise the points on the boundary as the most intense colours.
The boundary of the domian is labelled by hues. Toward the centre, we
sense a balanced spectral distribution and recognise it as neutral like
white, grey and black. The distance to the centre is called chroma.</p>
<p>There is a related concept called saturation. It is defined to be
colourfulness of object to the brightness of the object. Note that
chroma is colourfulness of object to the brightness of the reference
object and that lightness is the brightness of the object to the
brightness of the reference object. Thus we see that saturation is
chroma to lightness. Thus each circular cone (consisting lines of a
given slope in each 2D slice passing through the lightness axis) in the
normalised sensation/colour space has the same saturation. As the cones
open wider, saturation increases.</p>
<h1 id="sec:application">Application</h1>
<p>Thus painting is trying to reproduce light to cause the same
responses of the cones as caused by reflected light of an object. Note
that the responses are those before processed by the precognitive
lightnesscolour constancy process. Hence picking the right metameric
packet is difficult. Mixing paints is also difficult due to our visual
system. One has only an estimation of spectral properties of paints when
attempting to mix the right metameric packet.</p>
<p>For digital painting, the canvas is the screen which emits light. Its
brightness should be calibrated to match that of the environment so that
our visual system estimates the correct illumination condition in which
to place the digital painting. Painting digitally still is trying to
reproduce light to cause the same responses of the cones as caused by
reflected light of an object.</p>
